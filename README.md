## Optimizations

The base code is filthy, I tried to do what I could to restructure the thing but it's complicated without breaking
everything...

Otherwise the script is only Python3 compatible, so it works on most machines now

## FAQ

#### I can use this script on any Linux distribution?

No, this script was designed for Ubuntu/Debian systems by the original author. It is nonetheless usable on distributions
based on these, but remember that it was not intended for!

#### Why didn't you make a pull request to the original author?

I already offered my update on a previous repository, however, no news from the base author, so I decided to make it a
separate repo to be better referenced while mentioning the base author !

However if he wants me to delete the repo in the future or if he wants to get the code back, I'll do whatever he wants.

#### Is using this script safe?

Honestly, yes and no. It is clear that some tools are too old/not functional today, or even can crash your distribution.
However, it remains usable and not everything is to be thrown away, which is why I reworked it.

#### I have a problem with the script... What to do?
